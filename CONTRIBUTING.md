Then, you can find the project documentation [here](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/documentation/blob/master/README.md). Everything is explained in details in here, so please read it once before asking questions.

If you found a bug or a typo, you should search if your problem was already stated on a closed issue first. Sometimes the "bug" is not one at all. If not, please fill an issue.
